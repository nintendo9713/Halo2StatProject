Final Update - Servers were shut down today, 2/9/21.  I ran this thing for 350 tags personally, and got messages from many others using it.  Was fun while it lasted.

# HaloStatProject
Python code for saving Halo 2,3, and Reach stats from gamertags from Bungie.net - *not* the web pages.

To use - put gamertag into any of the blanks on the left (so you can add all your 2 months), and click Download.  This can take a while, depends on server load. 15,000 games has gone as quick as 8 minutes, and as long as 90 minutes.

Parsing takes under 3 seconds and will give you a nice printout of some random stats I programmed in.  I'm open to more. Put people you want to compare yourself against in the fields as well (so you can put your friend's tag + their 2 months) and get a cumulative head to head for ranked game k/d.
